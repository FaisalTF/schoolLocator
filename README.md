## Washington Public School Locator
This project showcases public schools around the state of Washington. A list of all current public schools in Washington State for the 2021-2022 school year as listed on the OSPI School Directory is presented in a web app.

This project was built with four main utilities in mind:

1- To serve as a pltform visualizing broad geographical trends in the distribution of schools aorund the state of Washigton. This could help identify disparities in educational opportunities across different geographical and socioeconomical factors.

2- To visualize schools in proximity to a specific address or monument; this could help identify the strength of a single point in educational opportunities in proximity. This could be helpful in comparing resedential addresses, for example.

3- To visualize schools relative to each other, providing the ability to compare different schools and clusters.

4= To serve as a directory, the comprehensive list of schools is listed along with addresses, and can serve for those looking to browse or locate a school. The information present can also easily be expanded to show more information that is already present within the data.

The web application currently includes the following features:

Geocoding:
The web app includes a search bar where existing monuments or addresses may be located, besides the schools from the data.

Additional features to be potentially implemented:
List Auto Sorting:
Once a school is selected, the list gets resorted to show the nearest schools to the selected school. I tried to implement this feature and included most of the
